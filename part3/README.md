# The phonebook application

The phonebook application consists of these two projects:

## phonebook-frontend

This project is based on `part2\phonebook` project with some changes:

- The `json-server` module and `db.json` file is removed
- The hardcoded backend URL is changed to a relative URL

## phonebook-app

This project contains the backend code - and - the production build of frontend code (placed in `public_html` directory, served as static content).
